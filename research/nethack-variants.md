## 1. SLASH'EM (Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack – Extended Magic)

SLASH'EM, developed by Warren Cheung starting in 1997, is a significant NetHack variant that expands the original game with new roles, races, monsters, items, and special levels. It features a larger dungeon, redesigned Gehennom with fewer maze levels, and introduces the Monk class, conducts, and Sokoban levels, some of which were later incorporated into vanilla NetHack. SLASH'EM supports enhanced graphical interfaces like Vulture and noegnud, is cross-platform, and its last stable release was in 2006. It has been influential in the NetHack community.

## 2. SLASH'EM Extended (SLEX)

SLASH'EM Extended, developed by AmyBSOD, is a "kitchen sink" variant based on SLASH'EM that significantly increases dungeon difficulty and content. It adds numerous new roles, races, monsters, and special levels, including content from obscure variants and "evil" patch ideas. Due to some content being inappropriate or illegal in some regions, access to its repository requires an account and includes warnings. Despite this, features like in-game monster lookup and monster templates have influenced other variants such as SlashTHEM.
