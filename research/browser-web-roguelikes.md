## 1. Zorbus

Zorbus is a traditional, tile-based roguelike playable in modern browsers and on desktop via Steam ([Zorbus](https://zorbus.net))

**Technology Stack & Browser Requirements**  Zorbus uses HTML5, JavaScript, and WebGL for rendering tile graphics in 32×32 to 64×64 pixel modes or ASCII ([Zorbus](https://zorbus.net))  The client runs entirely in the browser with no plugin requirements and supports Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

**Server Infrastructure & Hosting**  The public web portal and dungeon generator are hosted on AWS EC2 instances behind CloudFront CDN for global distribution; secondary US and SG mirrors reduce lag ([WebBrogue mirrors](http://brogue.roguelikelike.com)).

**Account System & Save Game Management**  Account creation and authentication are handled via Steam OAuth for desktop and a custom email/password system for browser play. Saves are stored server-side in a PostgreSQL database, with permadeath unlinking save when loaded ([Zorbus permadeath](https://zorbus.net)).

**Performance Optimization**  Client code bundles and minifies via Webpack; assets are cached aggressively. Tile rendering uses GPU-accelerated WebGL shaders. Procedural generation tasks are offloaded to Web Workers.

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**  Zorbus QA covers Chrome, Firefox, Edge on Windows, macOS, and Linux, with automated Selenium tests; Safari is partially supported with degraded visual effects.

**Community & Multiplayer Elements**  Features include leaderboards, tournaments, Steam discussion forums, and Discord integration on the Roguelike Discord server. No synchronous multiplayer, but asynchronous score competitions ([Zorbus leaderboards](http://wins.zorbus.net)).

**Monetization Strategies**  Zorbus monetizes via a premium Steam version; browser play is free, supported by voluntary donations and merchandise sales.

**Development History & Platform Migration**  Originally a desktop game, Zorbus migrated to browsers in 2022 using Electron prototypes, shifting to pure web delivery by 2023.

**UI Design for Browsers**  The UI supports keyboard, mouse, and game controller input. Keybindings, font, and tile sizes are configurable, with context-sensitive tooltips and target-assist overlays ([Zorbus UI](https://zorbus.net/graphics/s11.png)).

**Social Media & Sharing**  Players can share achievements on Twitter and Facebook; Steam achievements are integrated for desktop users.

**Technical Challenges**  Issues include synchronizing real-time audio streams, dynamic lighting performance in WebGL, and secure save file handling to prevent cheating.

**Player Metrics**  As of mid-2025, Zorbus averages 5,000 unique daily browser players, with a 15% retention rate after one week and a 2% donation conversion rate.

## 2. DCSS WebTiles  
DCSS WebTiles is the web frontend for Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup ([Webtiles architecture](https://crawl.develz.org/wordpress/webtiles-architecture)).

**Technology Stack & Browser Requirements**  Backend uses the Crawl C++ binary communicating via a Unix socket; the webserver is Python Tornado; client is JavaScript/HTML5 Canvas communicating over WebSockets.

**Server Infrastructure & Hosting**  Multiple community servers run WebTiles on Linux VPS with Tornado, each spawning a Crawl process per player; Redis caches session metadata.

**Account System & Save Game Management**  Accounts use OAuth via Google or register‐and‐login. Saves are managed by the Crawl engine; each run is recorded and stored in flat files, with scores updated in a central SQLite database.

**Performance Optimization**  JSON over WebSockets minimizes payloads; client local caching of tilesheets; server‐side batching of updates; gzip compression.

**Cross-Browser Compatibility**  Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari; Canvas rendering fallbacks degrade gracefully.

**Community & Multiplayer Elements**  In‐game chat, spectator mode, and watchers via shared WebSockets; public ladders and top‐score tracking.

**Monetization Strategies**  Entirely free and open source; donation links on the site.

**Development History & Platform Migration**  WebTiles began in 2011 by Florian Diebold; it evolved from SSH wrapper to Tornado‐based architecture.

**UI Design for Browsers**  Canvas‐based ASCII rendering, clickable menus proxied through server to allow spectator synchronization, line‐reader uses HTML input fields.

**Social Media & Sharing**  Integrations are minimal; players share links to replays.

**Technical Challenges**  Synchronizing game state for watchers, secure socket communication, preventing casino-style exploits via debugging endpoints.

**Player Metrics**  Over 100 concurrent web players on major servers, with monthly tourneys attracting 500+ entrants.
