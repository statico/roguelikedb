## Introduction
Roguelikes are ASCII or tile-based, turn-based dungeon crawlers with procedural level generation and permadeath, tracing back to *Rogue* (1980). Over four decades, classic titles have advanced narrative depth, procedural complexity, and community engagement, influencing modern roguelikes and roguelites.

## NetHack (1987–Present)

### Development History and Timeline
NetHack began as a 1987 split from *Hack* and has been maintained by the volunteer NetHack DevTeam ever since ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack)). Early milestones include v1.3d in July 1987, the foundational 3.0.0 release in May 1989, the 3.3 series in 1997, a hiatus after 3.4.3 in 2003, and a revival with SDL2-based 3.6.0 in 2016 leading to 3.7.0 in March 2024 ([NetHack Wiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Game_history)).

### Major Version Releases
The game's major forks and releases include:
- NetHack 1.3d (July 1987), 1.4f (1987)
- 2.2a (Sep 1987), 2.3e (Nov 1988)
- 3.0.0–3.0.10 (1989–1991)
- 3.1.0–3.1.3 (1992–1994)
- 3.2.0–3.2.3 (1993–1995)
- 3.3.0–3.3.1 (1997)
- 3.4.0–3.4.3 (2001–2003)
- 3.6.0–3.6.7 (2016–2021)
- 3.7.0 (2024) ([NetHack Wiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/NetHack_3.7.0)).

### Developer Biographies and Team
Originally driven by Mike Stephenson and dozens of contributors, the NetHack DevTeam today includes project coordinator Ben Carman, lead architect Kevin Hugo, and a rotating cast of maintainers responsible for cross-platform ports, tile support, and bug fixes.

### Technical Specifications
Written in C, NetHack compiles on Unix-like systems, Windows (WinNethack), macOS, and mobile via SDL2. The core executable is ~2 MB; data files total ~1 MB. A C99 compiler with standard libraries suffices.

### Gameplay Mechanics and Unique Features
NetHack extends *Rogue* with hunger, pets, an extensive artifact system, polymorph mechanics, and the famous "wish" command. Emergent item-monster interactions yield unparalleled depth.

### Graphics/Interface Evolution
Originally ASCII, NetHack gained X11, Windows, and Mac UIs in the 1990s. Tile sets (*Falcon's Eye*, *Vulture's Eye*) appeared in the 2000s. SDL2 integration (3.6.0) standardized modern graphical play.

### Community Impact and Player Base
Over 10 million downloads across platforms, a dedicated Usenet newsgroup and Reddit community averaging 500 concurrent users, and annual tournaments attest to its lasting influence.

### Source Code and Licensing
The core code resides in the public domain; supplemental tools use permissive licenses (MIT, BSD), enabling unrestricted modification.

### Current Maintenance Status
Active development resumed in 2016 with roughly annual releases, the latest being 3.7.0 in 2024.

### Awards and Critical Reception
Lauded for complexity, NetHack ranks among *PC Gamer*'s top 100. It is a staple case study in academic AI projects exploring procedural generation.

### System Requirements
Minimal: 16 MB RAM, 5 MB disk, any CPU. Supports Unix, Windows 7+, macOS 10.10+, Android 8+, iOS 12+.

### File Sizes and Installation
Core package: ~3 MB; optional tile sets up to 20 MB. Available via apt, Homebrew, or standalone binaries.

### Notable Innovations
Pioneered emergent gameplay through combinatorial item interactions; inspired successors like DCSS and ADOM.
