# Research Report on Themed and Licensed Roguelike Games

This report provides a detailed exploration of roguelike games themed around licensed properties and specific motifs, focusing on development challenges, legal issues, fan-made versus official distinctions, and unique thematic mechanics. The themes covered include Star Wars, Doctor Who, Fallout, Warhammer 40k, anime/manga-inspired, mythology-based (Greek, Norse, Egyptian), horror-themed, steampunk, and post-cyberpunk roguelikes.

## Star Wars Roguelike Games

Star Wars roguelikes face significant challenges due to the strict licensing and legal frameworks controlled by Disney. Developers must navigate complex licensing agreements that restrict creative freedom and content scope. Fan-made projects often face takedown notices despite being non-commercial, highlighting the tension between fan creativity and intellectual property enforcement. Thematic mechanics in Star Wars roguelikes typically include Force powers, lightsaber combat, and space exploration, but these are tightly regulated by licensing terms ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/17xgsxi/star_wars_developer_strikes_back_at_classaction), [tind.wipo.int](https://tind.wipo.int/record/45851/files/wipo-pub-2022-en-mastering-the-game.pdf), [askagamedev.tumblr.com](https://askagamedev.tumblr.com/post/660690063931392000/with-the-star-wars-license-now-being-open-how)).

## Doctor Who Roguelike Games

Doctor Who roguelikes are rare and mostly fan-made due to the BBC's cautious licensing approach. The BBC rarely endorses fan projects, creating legal uncertainty. Official Doctor Who games tend to focus on narrative rather than roguelike mechanics. Fans often prefer unofficial games for creative freedom despite legal risks. Licensing challenges stem from the BBC's strict IP control ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/gallifrey/comments/t6srga/do_the_bbc_allow_doctor_who_fan_games), [pcgamer.com](https://www.pcgamer.com/saturday-crapshoot-destiny-of-the-doctors)).

## Fallout-Themed Roguelikes

Fallout-themed roguelikes draw inspiration from the franchise's post-apocalyptic setting, turn-based combat, and survival mechanics. Bethesda controls licensing, so many roguelikes inspired by Fallout avoid direct IP use, creating original worlds with similar themes. Unique mechanics include V.A.T.S.-style targeting, radiation management, and faction dynamics. Fan-made projects innovate beyond licensed limits but face potential legal issues ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/172ktxa/looking_for_roguelikes_likehave_the_same), [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDqVGqTfMYY)).

## Warhammer 40k Roguelikes

Warhammer 40k roguelikes are limited by Games Workshop's selective licensing, often restricted to specific factions. Unauthorized use has led to lawsuits against fan projects. Thematic mechanics focus on dark sci-fi, tactical combat, and faction play. Fan projects operate in a legal gray area, balancing homage with infringement risks ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/Warhammer40k/comments/wbdufz/whats_your_opinion_about_games_workshop_licensing), [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOVrmfXolQg)).

## Anime/Manga-Inspired Roguelikes

Anime and manga-inspired roguelikes combine classic roguelike elements with anime aesthetics and fast-paced combat. Licensing specific anime IPs is challenging, so many games are original creations influenced by anime style. Unique mechanics include combo systems and character transformations. Fan-made anime roguelikes are common; official licensed ones are fewer due to complex rights ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/c8riat/anime_roguelikes), [gamerbraves.com](https://www.gamerbraves.com/compile-heart-unveils-scar-lead-salvation-a-challenging-roguelike-shooter-with-an-anime-twist)).

## Mythology-Based Roguelikes (Greek, Norse, Egyptian)

Mythology-based roguelikes use public domain mythologies, allowing creative freedom without licensing issues. Greek-themed games feature Olympian gods and heroic quests; Norse-themed ones emphasize Viking culture and Ragnarok; Egyptian-themed roguelikes incorporate gods and curses. Unique mechanics include godly blessings and mythic powers. Examples include "Achilles Survivor" (Greek) and "Ragnar" (Norse) ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/nafbft/are_there_any_rpgs_based_on_greek_mythology_or), [roguebasin.com](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/List_of_Roguelikes_by_Theme)).

## Horror-Themed Roguelikes

Horror roguelikes leverage procedural generation and permadeath to create tension. Unique mechanics include sanity meters, resource scarcity, and environmental storytelling. Licensing issues arise only with use of established horror IPs. Development challenges involve balancing difficulty and narrative immersion. Notable games use cryptic and cursed themes to heighten fear ([rogueliker.com](https://rogueliker.com/horror-roguelikes), [surrealandcreepy.wordpress.com](https://surrealandcreepy.wordpress.com/2025/01/28/mysterious-cryptic-and-probably-cursed-horror-roguelike-games)).

## Steampunk Roguelikes

Steampunk roguelikes combine Victorian aesthetics with steam-powered technology. Development challenges include integrating complex mechanical systems into procedural gameplay. Unique mechanics focus on gadget crafting and gear upgrades. Licensing is generally not restrictive as steampunk is a genre rather than a specific IP ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/rwelk0/looking_for_an_interesting_roguelike_that_has), [rogueliker.com](https://rogueliker.com/best-roguelike-games)).

## Post-Cyberpunk Roguelikes

Post-cyberpunk roguelikes explore dystopian futures with themes of poverty, transhumanism, and tech control. Mechanics include hacking and cybernetic enhancements. Licensing issues arise with established cyberpunk IPs, so many games use original settings. Development challenges include blending narrative with roguelike randomness. Example: "ZeroDay.exe" ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikes/comments/17e3lb4/gritty_near_future_scificyberpunkroguelikes), [medium.com](https://medium.com/@rsmeers/roguelikes-issues-trending-genre-4cc7e128bdcb)).

---

In conclusion, licensed roguelike games face considerable legal and development challenges, especially with major IPs like Star Wars, Doctor Who, Fallout, and Warhammer 40k. Fan-made games often push creative boundaries but risk legal repercussions. Mythology-based, horror, steampunk, and post-cyberpunk roguelikes enjoy greater creative freedom, resulting in diverse and innovative gameplay experiences.
