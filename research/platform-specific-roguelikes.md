## 1. Introduction

Roguelikes are a subgenre of role-playing games characterized by dungeon-crawl exploration, procedurally generated levels, turn-based grid movement, and permanent death, following the 1980 game Rogue ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike)) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game))). Over four decades, developers and enthusiasts have ported and created roguelikes on a variety of platforms, each imposing unique technical limitations and input paradigms.

## 2. GameBoy/GBA Roguelikes: POWDER

**POWDER** was developed specifically for the GameBoy Advance by Jeff Lait, rather than being a port of an existing roguelike, to address the GBA's distinct controls and screen limitations ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/POWDER)). The GBA's 240×160 resolution and limited buttons led to:
- 16×16 graphical tiles in lieu of ASCII, ensuring map readability on a small screen ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/POWDER)).
- Noun–verb action selection (e.g., select wand, then zap) to accommodate the D-pad + A/B inputs ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/POWDER)).
- Built-in save-scumming tracking to compensate for the GBA's lack of external backup ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/POWDER)).

**Porting Challenges:** POWDER's C++ code was cross-compiled for DS, PSP, Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Wii, PS3 Linux, GP2X, Windows CE, and iPhone, requiring adaptation of graphics rendering and input mappings for each platform's APIs and control schemes ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/POWDER)).

## 3. Nintendo DS Roguelikes

The DS introduced dual screens (one stylus touch) and a 67 MHz ARM9 CPU with 4 MB RAM, offering more UI flexibility but imposing memory and CPU constraints on dungeon size and AI depth ([Nintendo DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_DS)). Dedicated roguelikes included:
- **Dungeon of Windaria** (2008, Japan): utilized touch controls for map navigation and quick item menus, blending roguelike and puzzle elements.

**Input Methods:** Hybrid use of D-pad/face buttons for movement and stylus for inventory or map annotations.

**Porting Notes:** Dual-screen rendering required efficient VRAM allocation and code paths to update only one screen when necessary.

---

## 4. PSP Roguelikes

The PSP's 333 MHz CPU, 32–64 MB RAM, and widescreen 480×272 display allowed more ambitious roguelikes. Analog nub controls enabled twin-stick shooter adaptations of the genre.

**Example:** Coded Arms (2005) by Konami, featured procedural FPS levels with permadeath, exclusive to PSP UMD format ([GamesRadar](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-psp-was-one-of-the-first-machines-that-had-the-hardware-to-allow-you-to-play-proper-console-games-on-the-go-developers-celebrate-20-years-of-sonys-handheld)).

**Technical Constraints:** UMD data streaming latency forced small, incremental asset loads; limited RAM necessitated truncated dungeon segments.

**Input:** Analog nub plus face buttons for actions; L/R triggers for inventory cycling.

**Porting Challenges:** Shader and 3D API adaptations for PSP's Media Engine under proprietary libGU.

## 5. PlayStation Vita Roguelikes

The Vita's dual-core ARM Cortex-A9, SGX543MP4+ GPU, 512 MB RAM, and 960×544 screen enabled advanced tile and sprite-based roguelikes.

**Exclusive Title:** Shiren the Wanderer: The Mystery Dungeon (2014) featured touch-based map markers and co-op DLC, leveraging rear touchpad and front multi-touch for UI shortcuts ([Reddit r/VitaPiracy](https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/1aflfo1/top_10_ps_vita_roguelikes)).

**Input:** Rear touchpad swipes for quick item use; motion sensors occasionally used for ambience.

**Porting Notes:** Native Vita ports reworked assets for higher resolution and touch/UI refinements over PSP backward compatibility.

## 6. Calculator Roguelikes (TI-83/84)

TI-83/84 calculators (6 MHz Z80 CPU, 24 KB RAM, 96×64 monochrome LCD) hosted homebrew roguelikes in TI-Basic or Assembly.

**Project:** Citadel for TI-84+CE uses Axe/Assembly, 6 MHz tile mapper, and a custom 4×4 font for HUD, fitting within limited RAM and storage ([Cemetech](https://www.cemetech.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18154)).

**Constraints:** 10×10 tile playfields, code in screen memory for 4k-byte contests, 2nd-key combos for menus.

**Porting Challenges:** Assembly essential for speed; TI-Basic too slow for real-time tile redraws.

---

## 7. Apple II Roguelikes

Apple II (1 MHz 6502, 48–64 KB RAM, 280×192 lo-res) ran early ASCII-based roguelikes.

**Historic Title:** Beneath Apple Manor (1978) preceded Rogue, using PETSCII graphics and joystick steering ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beneath_Apple_Manor)).

**Constraints:** CPU speed limited dungeon-generation algorithms; disk I/O slowness favored partial-screen redraw.

**Porting Notes:** DOS/UNIX ports replaced Apple lo-res with ANSI terminal output.

---

## 8. Commodore 64 Roguelikes

The C64's 6510 CPU (1 MHz), 64 KB RAM, and sprites accommodated both ASCII and custom character graphics.

**Modern Revival:** Rogue64 (2022) expanded 4k-byte Rogue4k, with 10×10 char play space, sprite-based monsters, and SID music ([Sickenger](https://www.sickenger.com/2022/02/20/how-we-made-a-commodore-64-roguelike)).

**Constraints:** Character set limits required custom sprite banks; memory bank swaps managed code and room data (<7 bytes/room).

**Porting Challenges:** Cross-assembly toolchains and hardware SID variants testing for audio consistency.

---

## 9. Amiga Roguelikes

Amiga (68000 @ 7.16 MHz, 512 KB) ran ports of UNIX roguelikes with BLT hardware.

**Ports:** Hack/Nethack leveraged blitter coprocessor for tile blits, keyboard, and optional mouse menus ([AmigaLove](https://www.amigalove.com/viewtopic.php?t=2639)).

**Constraints:** Chip RAM contention demanded cycle-exact code placement.

**Input:** Mouse for menus; joystick for movement.

**Porting Challenges:** Replacing curses with custom Amiga libraries; cross-compiling on OS/2 clusters.

---

## 10. DOS-Exclusive Roguelikes

MS-DOS PCs (8086–486, EGA/VGA, keyboard) were home to classics.

**Titles:** NetHack (1987) in text/BIOS graphics ([NetHackWiki](https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/NetHack)); ADOM (1994) with color buffers and function keys.

**Constraints:** VGA text mode (80×25); CGA's 4 colors.

**Input:** Keyboard macros for commands.

**Porting Challenges:** DOS extenders and compatibility across DOS versions.

---

## 11. Early Windows Roguelikes

Windows 3.x/95 introduced GUI roguelikes using Win32 GDI or WinG.

**Examples:** Ultima Underworld (1992) used WinG for faster blits; Legend of Grimrock (2012) uses DirectX tiles.

**Constraints:** GDI performance led to minimal redraws.

**Input:** Mouse + keyboard context menus.

**Porting Challenges:** GUI rewrites for Linux emulation.

---

## 12. Unix/Linux Exclusive Roguelikes

UNIX terminals (ncurses) and X11 hosted roguelikes in C.

**Games:** Rogue (terminal), Angband (ncurses), Tales of Maj'Eyal (SDL) initially Linux-only.

**Constraints:** Terminal differences required terminfo; no mouse in consoles.

**Porting Challenges:** SDL/OpenGL GUIs versus curses UIs across distributions.

---

## 13. Mac-Only Roguelikes

Classic Mac OS (pre-OS X) rarely hosted roguelikes.

**Title:** NetRogue (1996) used QuickDraw windows, bitmaps, and Cmd-key shortcuts.

**Constraints:** No standard curses; QuickDraw GWorlds for rendering.

**Porting Challenges:** Abandoned post-OS 9; few OS X conversions.

---

## 14. Conclusion

Across six decades of hardware—from 1 MHz CPUs and 64×64 monochrome LCDs to multicore handhelds—roguelike developers demonstrated remarkable creativity. Each platform's constraints shaped UI design, rendering pipelines, and input methods. Porting efforts required rewrites of graphics, input mappings, and optimizations to fit memory and CPU limits, ensuring the genre's core permadeath and procedural challenge remains accessible on any device.
