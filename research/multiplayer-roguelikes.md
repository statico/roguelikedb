## 10. Modern Discord-integrated Roguelikes

Discord's Social SDK enables game developers to integrate high-quality voice chat, messaging, and social features directly into games ([Discord Press](https://discord.com/press-releases/social-sdk-ingame-communications)). This integration enhances multiplayer experiences by unifying in-game and Discord communications, supporting cross-platform chat, linked channels for guilds and squads, and voice chat. Several games have adopted this SDK to improve player retention and community engagement, with features like chat history, custom audio processing, and diagnostics. This represents a modern trend in multiplayer roguelikes leveraging existing social platforms.

## Conclusion
Multiplayer roguelikes span a diverse spectrum from classic text-based MUDs like CoffeeMUD to graphical MMORPGs like Eternal Lands and open-source projects like MAngband and Crossfire. Development histories range from decades-long community-driven efforts to modern platform integrations. Server infrastructures vary from community-hosted to dedicated cloud servers with advanced management. Multiplayer mechanics emphasize cooperative and competitive play with persistent worlds and social features. Active communities support these games via forums, Discord, and in-game tools.
