# 7-Day Roguelike Challenge: Comprehensive Individual Game Profiles

The Seven-Day Roguelike (7DRL) Challenge is an annual game‐development event in which participants attempt to create a complete, playable roguelike in seven days. Originating on the /r/roguelikedev Usenet group in 2005, the challenge encourages rapid prototyping, creative iteration, and community feedback. Over the years, several 7DRL entries have become influential commercial titles, pushing the boundaries of procedural generation, interface design, and genre innovation.

## HyperRogue (Zeno Rogue)

**7DRL Year and Development Period**: The first minimal HyperRogue prototype was created in November 2011; a full hyperbolic‐geometry roguelike version was completed during the March 2012 7DRL Challenge (March 1–7, 2012). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue))

**Key 7-Day Innovations**: Live hyperbolic geometry engine, dynamic world tiling, non‐Euclidean level generation preserving roguelike procedural fairness. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue))

**Community Reception**: Praised as "one of the most interesting roguelikes" (Exploring Roguelike Games), and noted for its educational value in hyperbolic geometry. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue))

**Current Status (2025)**: Active development with version 13.x in beta, regular updates on GitHub, community mods on Discord. Available on Steam, GOG, and F-Droid.

**Post-Challenge Development**: After the challenge, Josh Ge released an open alpha (May 24, 2015), public beta (May 6, 2017), and Steam Early Access (October 16, 2017). Continual updates added over 1,000 parts, detailed stealth mechanics, destructible terrain, and storyline missions. Full release is planned after minor polish updates. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmind))

**Supported Platforms**: Windows (native), with unofficial Wine support on Linux/macOS. ([Official website](http://www.gridsagegames.com/cogmind/))

**Technical Specifications**: Written in C++ using SDL2. ANSI/ASCII art graphics with custom UI framework. Procedural map generation supporting multi‐level complex layouts and emergent robot AI behaviours. ([PCGamer](http://www.pcgamer.com/cogmind-is-a-sci-fi-roguelike-about-building-yourself-from-salvaged-parts/))

**Key 7-Day Innovations**: Integration of modular equipment as core combat and progression, advanced user‐friendly interface, and living AI ecosystems allowing non‐scripted interactions. ([Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/10/11/cogmind-robot-roguelike/))

**Community Reception**: Acclaimed for its depth and UI, featured in Destructoid's Top 33 Indie Games of 2016. Maintains a passionate forum community averaging hundreds of daily posts. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogmind))

**Current Status (2025)**: Continual free updates, approaching version 1.0 full release. Steam reviews: "Overwhelmingly Positive" (97% positive on >4,000 reviews). Active modding community on GitHub and Discord.

## 868-HACK (Michael Brough)

**7DRL Year and Development Period**: Began March 2013 as part of the March 1–7, 2013 7DRL Challenge (originally titled "86856527"). Development extended beyond the initial week but core mechanics were prototyped in seven days. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK))

**Developer(s)**: Michael Brough (solo). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK))

**Original 7-Day Prototype**: Introduced a 6×6 grid hack'n'slash aesthetic with ZX Spectrum–style graphics, procedurally generated cyberpunk "nodes," and emergent balance via enemy spawn‐driven loot risk. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK))

**Post-Challenge Development**: Six months of polish, balance, and porting; released on iOS (August 30, 2013), Windows/macOS (January 26, 2015), followed by PLAN.B expansion (July 23, 2017). ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK))

**Supported Platforms**: iOS, Windows, macOS. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK))

**Technical Specifications**: Written in Lua using Love2D engine for cross‐platform support; custom tile‐based rendering mimicking 8-bit visuals.
