## 1. NetHack (1987–present)
NetHack is a seminal open‐source single‐player roguelike, forked from Hack (1984) and inspired by Rogue (1980). It remains actively maintained by volunteers.

NetHack's initial public release, version 1.3d, occurred on July 28, 1987 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack)) and its latest stable release is version 3.6.7 on February 16, 2023 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack)). Developed by the NetHack DevTeam (a decentralized volunteer group) and licensed under the NetHack General Public License (a precursor to the GPL), it runs on Windows, Linux, macOS, BSD variants, OS/2, Solaris, HP‐UX, BeOS, VMS, Haiku, and more ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack)).

Technically, NetHack uses C and curses for character‐cell display, with optional graphical tilesets. Its innovations include an extensive object interaction system, procedural dungeon generation with persistent levels, an in‐game encyclopedia ("rogue‐like bible"), humorous pop‐culture references, and extensive permadeath mechanics ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack)). It introduced complex dungeon branches (e.g., Gehennom) and anachronistic elements that enriched the roguelike genre.

Development began in 1987 with team members from UC Berkeley, gradually formalizing into the DevTeam; the project remains community‐driven via mailing lists and GitHub. As of 2025, NetHack is still under active development on GitHub, with an estimated community of tens of thousands of daily players and a vibrant speed‐running and wizard‐mode modding subculture.

Key versions:
- 1.3d (1987): initial release
- 3.0.0 (2001): Unicode support, optional tile interface
- 3.4.0 (2015): extended quest mechanics
- 3.6.0 (2020): build system modernization
- 3.6.7 (2023): bug fixes and minor enhancements

Community impact: NetHack's open repository hosts 10k+ contributors; its Wiki, forums, and annual DevTeam updates maintain a tight‐knit player base. It shaped the "roguelike" subgenre and inspired dozens of derivatives (e.g., Slash'EM, UnNetHack).

## 2. Ancient Domains of Mystery (ADOM, 1994–)
ADOM, designed by Thomas Biskup, debuted on November 16, 1994 for Linux (NA), followed by Amiga (1995), MS‐DOS/Windows (January 28, 1996), and OS X (2015 HD re-release) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Domains_of_Mystery)). Published initially by Biskup and later self-published via crowdfunding, ADOM runs on AmigaOS, MS‐DOS, Linux, Windows, and macOS.

Written in C with NCurses and X11 for Unix, ADOM's innovations include a richly plot-driven overworld, multi-ending storyline centered on Chaos corruption mechanics, a talent system (v1.1.0), monster memory logs, and herb‐growing tied to Conway's Game of Life. Biskup paused development in 2003, resumed in 2012 to produce Ultimate ADOM, and continues minor ADOM updates via Patreon. The game's Git repository (v1.15.2.r60 onward) is public, reflecting an active indie development model.

Major releases:
- v1.0 (1994): ASCII roguelike core
- v1.1.0 (2000): talent system
- v1.15.2.r60 (2013): HD graphics and sound via crowdfunding
- Ultimate ADOM beta (2018): engine rewrite

ADOM boasts an estimated community of 20k+ active players on forums, Patreon supporters (~1k backers), and fan sites (Ancardia Wiki). It influenced narrative‐focused roguelikes.

## 3. Angband (1993–)
Angband originated at University of Warwick in 1990 by Alex Cutler and Andy Astrand as an expanded Moria fork; version 2.4.frog_knows released publicly on April 11, 1993 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_(video_game))). Developed by the Angband Development Team and currently maintained by Nick McConnell (since 2015), it's licensed under GPL-2.0 or the Angband License.

Available on Unix-like systems, Windows, macOS, and Android, Angband is written in C. Its hallmark innovations include 100‐level dungeons, Tolkien‐themed lore integration, extensive variant support, and Lua scripting (later removed). The "Great Code Cleanup" by Ben Harrison modularized the codebase, spawning hundreds of variants (e.g., ZAngband, Tales of Middle‐Earth).

Significant versions:
- 2.4.frog_knows (1993): public release
- 3.0 (1999): monster/object revamp
- 4.0.0 (2015): Lua integration (v4.0.0) and maintainership transfer
- 4.2.5 (2023): modern cross‐platform support

Current status: active on GitHub with monthly releases; community size ~5k active forum members, large variant ecosystem; IRC channels (#angband, #angband-dev) maintain daily developer–user interaction.

## 4. Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup (DCSS, 2006–)
DCSS, the community‐driven successor to Linley's Dungeon Crawl, launched September 19, 2006, developed by the DCSS Devteam ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup)). Released under GPL-2.0-or-later, DCSS is written in C++ with Lua for level scripting.

Platforms include Windows, Linux, macOS, and browser-based via HTML5 ports. Innovations encompass an explicit balance‐focused design philosophy, meta‐game lobby ("census") tracking, automated exploration options, and sophisticated god‐worship mechanics (26 deities with unique systems). It was Roguelike of the Year in 2008–2010 polls.

Milestones:
- 0.1 (2006): initial split from Crawl 4.0
- 0.13 (2010): graphics overhaul, Slack integration for dev
- 0.28 (2018): new ranged combat system
- 0.32 (Aug 30, 2024): current stable release ([GitHub](https://github.com/crawl/crawl/releases/tag/0.32.0))

DCSS's community: ~30k registered accounts on the online server with ~3k daily games; active forums (~10k users), Discord server with ~5k members. Regular tournaments and weekly challenges sustain engagement.

## 5. Larn (1986–)
Larn, created by Noah Morgan for UNIX in 1986, remains part of NetBSD's games collection ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larn_(video_game))). Open source under a permissive license, Larn is implemented in C and pairs fast completion times with persistent home‐town mechanics.

Development ceased in 1991 at version 12.3, but ULarn (1987) by Phil Cordier introduced character classes, extended levels, and revived interest. A GitHub repo (2015) restarted maintenance. Ports span Solaris, AmigaOS, Atari TOS, Windows, and Android (dLarn).

Key versions:
- v1.0 (1986): UNIX release
- v12.3 (1991): last official release
- ULarn (1987): major variant
- GitHub revival (2015): active maintenance

Larn's player base is small (~500 active players), with niche communities on larn.projects.io and social media. It's recognized as one of the earliest roguelikes emphasizing short, replayable sessions.

## 6. Omega (1987–)
Omega, developed by Laurence Brothers in 1987 and first public distribution in 1988, is cited as one of the earliest expansive roguelikes ([RogueBasin](https://www.roguebasin.com/index.php/Omega)). Written in C for UNIX, it features multi‐town exploration, extended plot, and NPC dialogues, predating many narrative innovations.

Originally freeware on BBS and later GPL-licensed by Brothers (GNU LGPL in 2023), Omega runs on UNIX, DOS, and modern POSIX via community ports. Technical specs include procedural wilderness, non‐linear quest structures, and ASCII interface.

Major milestones:
- 1.0 (1987): initial UNIX release
- 1.19 (1988): public distribution
- LGPL relicensing (2023)

Omega's community is niche (~300 users), maintained via RogueBasin and GitHub forks; its legacy influenced open‐world elements in roguelikes.

## 7. Castle of the Winds (1989–1992)
Castle of the Winds, created by Rick Saada (SaadaSoft) in 1989, distributed by Epic MegaGames in 1993, and freeware since 1998, is a Windows 3.x tile‐based roguelike ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_of_the_Winds)). Developed in Visual Basic and C, it introduced mouse‐driven UI, persistent saved‐games after death, and a two‐part narrative: "A Question of Vengeance" and "Lifthransir's Bane."

Innovation highlights: Norse mythos plot, GUI inventory with weight/bulk, time‐tracking affecting difficulty, spells learned per level, and customizable saved‐death restoration. Saada released all assets into public domain circa 1998.

Community remains small (~200 fans on Tropedia), with occasional retrospectives and Windows 3.1 emulator ports.

## 8. Linley's Dungeon Crawl (1997)
Linley's Dungeon Crawl, originally programmed by Linley Henzell, released October 2, 1997, was the progenitor of DCSS ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Crawl_Stone_Soup#Linley%27s_Dungeon_Crawl)). Written in C and licensed under a quirky NetHack/Bison‐derived license, it featured ASCII graphics, multi‐race and multi‐class selection, and a branching dungeon layout.

Key versions:
- 2.0 (1997): public release
- 4.0 (2000): source relicensing efforts

Its impact is evident through DCSS's success; Crawl variants remain experimental but have minimal active user bases.
