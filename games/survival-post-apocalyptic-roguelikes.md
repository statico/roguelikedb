## 1. Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA)

Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead (CDDA) is an open-source survival horror roguelike. The first public release (version 0.1) occurred on 26 February 2013, with its latest stable snapshot (0.H "Herbert") released on 23 November 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataclysm:_Dark_Days_Ahead)).

Originally created by Whales and now maintained by Kevin Granade and a global volunteer community under the CleverRaven project, CDDA is distributed under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license with source code hosted on GitHub ([CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA](https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA)). It supports Linux, macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android platforms, and is written in C++ using ncurses for ASCII mode and SDL for graphical tilesets ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataclysm:_Dark_Days_Ahead)).

Key survival mechanics include procedurally generated worlds, scavenging, hunting, farming, vehicle construction, bionics installation, base-building, and temperature as well as body part simulation. Innovative features such as modular mods, detailed crafting, and multi-layered survival systems integrate seamlessly with permadeath and turn-based roguelike exploration ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataclysm:_Dark_Days_Ahead)).

Development began as a fork of the original Cataclysm project in early 2013 following the upstream author's discontinuation. A successful Kickstarter in June 2013 raised $9,492 for full-time development. Since 2015, an open-source launcher has simplified updates and mod management ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataclysm:_Dark_Days_Ahead)).

Active daily builds remain the mainline version; stable releases are snapshots. The project boasts 11,500 stars and 4,300 forks on GitHub, with active Discord, forum, and subreddit communities totaling tens of thousands of participants (GitHub Insights).

No official Steam release exists, but unofficial community packages appear occasionally.

## 2. UnReal World

UnReal World is a roguelike survival game set in Iron Age Finland, first released in 1992 and commercially distributed via Steam on 26 February 2016 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnReal_World)). Developers Sami Maaranen and Erkka Lehmus publish under Enormous Elk, and the game runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Initially ASCII-based, it transitioned to SDL in 2005 for native Windows and cross-platform support, rendering 2D animated sprites at a fixed 800×600 resolution ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnReal_World)).

Innovations include a realistic climate system with frostbite mechanics, detailed survival activities such as hunting, fishing, hideworking, shelter construction, and a blend of real-time and turn-based play. Random events like snowstorms and tornadoes create permadeath risk, while procedural wilderness generation and ten distinct Finnish cultures provide replayability. These systems integrate classic roguelike dungeon and wilderness exploration with rigorous environmental simulation ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnReal_World)).

Development highlights: ASCII fantasy roguelike origins (1992–95); survival features added in 1996; DOS-to-Windows port in 1999; SDL port in 2005; major AI and world expansions 2007–09; continuous updates through 2024 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnReal_World)).

Current version 3.50 beta receives frequent updates. Estimated community size includes ~50,000 Steam owners, several thousand forum members, and a subreddit of ~10,000. Steam reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive (95% of 10,000+ reviews).
