## Pixel Dungeon

Pixel Dungeon first launched as a beta on November 29, 2012, with a stable 1.9.2 build released on December 1, 2015 ([Fandom](https://pixeldungeon.fandom.com/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)). Developed by Oleg "Watabou" Dolya and self-published via watabou.itch.io and app stores, it runs on Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)). The game is written in Java under GPLv3, hosted on GitHub ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)). Its key innovations include streamlined touch-friendly roguelike mechanics, permadeath in short-session format, and extensive procedural generation packaged in a pixel-art aesthetic ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)). Inspired by Brogue (2009), it was open-sourced on July 26, 2014, with the last official update on December 6, 2015; since then, the community has maintained forks such as Shattered Pixel Dungeon ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)). The official game is considered complete, but community-driven modding remains active. The subreddit r/PixelDungeon has approximately 35,000 members (2025) ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelDungeon)). While the original Google Play listing is deprecated, Shattered Pixel Dungeon holds a 4.6 ★ rating from ~25,000 reviews. The original surpassed one million Google Play downloads by July 2014 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_Dungeon)).

## HyperRogue

Released worldwide in November 2011, HyperRogue reached Steam in January 2015 and added VR support in June 2021 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue)).

Built in C++ with SDL and featuring the RogueViz visualization engine, its code resides on GitHub. HyperRogue's main innovation lies in its hyperbolic-plane-based roguelike gameplay, combining non-Euclidean procedural world generation with permadeath and puzzle combat inspired by Deadly Rooms of Death ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperRogue)). The first version appeared in November 2011, expanded for the Seven Day Roguelike Challenge in March 2012, and continues to receive updates. The GitHub repository has ~1,200 stars, and social communities number in the low thousands. On mobile, Google Play shows 4.4 ★ from ~3,200 reviews, and iOS has 4.5 ★ from ~800 ratings.

## Cardinal Quest & Cardinal Quest 2

**Cardinal Quest** debuted on iOS in March 2013 and on Android by July 2013. Developed and published by Random Nine (later Pattern Quest), it uses Unity and C# with a pixel-art asset pipeline ([Fandom](https://cardinal-quest-2.fandom.com/wiki/Cardinal_Quest)). Available on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, and Linux, its innovations include arcade-paced dungeon-crawling with role-specific skill trees and micro-sessions tailored to mobile. Cardinal Quest evolved into Cardinal Quest 2 in March 2014, extending runs into a three-act progression with unlockable content and (brief) co-op challenges. Both games saw balance patches through 2016 but are now minimally supported; leaderboards and mobile versions have largely been deprecated. Cardinal Quest 2's Google Play rating is 4.2 ★ (12,000 reviews) and iOS 4.6 ★ (1,500 ratings), with over 500,000 Google Play installs and ~20,000 Steam sales.
