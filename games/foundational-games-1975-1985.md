# Foundational Roguelikes (1975–1985)

## Introduction
In the decade spanning 1975 to 1985, dungeon‐crawl role‐playing video games—later termed "roguelikes"—emerged as a vibrant subgenre. These titles featured procedurally generated levels, permadeath, and ASCII or character‐based graphics. This report surveys twelve seminal games, profiling their exact release dates, developers, publishers, platforms, technical specifications, key innovations, current availability, preservation status, and historical significance.

## Preservation Efforts and Historical Significance
Academic works (e.g., Tresca 2014; Barton & Stacks 2019; IEEE Insights 2016) document the genre's origins, emphasizing PLATO's pivotal role. PLATO emulators (Cybis, Cyber1) and archive.org preserve playable versions. The BSD Unix community's open‐source releases spurred an active preservation ecosystem, with code hosted on GitHub and mirrored in BSD ports repositories.  

The historical significance of these titles is profound: they established dungeon‐crawl mechanics, permadeath, procedural generation, and ASCII interfaces that underpin modern roguelikes and inspire procedural‐content genres in broader gaming. From Rutherford's lab‐crafted _pedit5_ to Toy and Wichman's university collaboration on _Rogue_, these foundational games chart the evolution of digital fantasy exploration.
