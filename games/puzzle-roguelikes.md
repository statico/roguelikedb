## Desktop Dungeons

**Release Date and Platforms**  
Desktop Dungeons was released on November 7, 2013, for Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and Android ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons)).  

**Developer and Publisher**  
Developed and published by QCF Design, a South African indie studio consisting of Rodain Joubert, Hendrik Lepp, and Richard Siow ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons)).  

**Technical Specifications**  
The game uses the Unity engine and features pixel art graphics designed by Derek Yu ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons)).  

**Puzzle-Roguelike Mechanics**  
Desktop Dungeons condenses traditional roguelike dungeon-crawling into 10–15 minute sessions, emphasizing optimization puzzles: players must plan routes to maximize experience and resources, utilize deity blessings under strict constraints, and manage health against powerful foes ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons#Gameplay)).  

**Key Innovations**  
Introduced gods altering dungeon rules mid-run, condensed permadeath runs into bite-sized puzzles, and leveraged unlockable meta-progression between runs ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons#Development)).  

**Development History**  
Conceived by Rodain Joubert in early 2010, Desktop Dungeons' free alpha released in November 2011, followed by a public beta in 2012. The full release came November 2013; a fully 3D remake, Desktop Dungeons: Rewind, launched April 18, 2023 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons#Remake)).  

**Current Status**  
The original title and its Rewind remake are actively supported with bug fixes; Rewind received community acclaim for modernizing visuals while retaining core puzzle-run mechanics.  

**Critical Reception**  
Praised for innovative design, Desktop Dungeons won Excellence in Design at the 2011 Independent Games Festival and placed #3 in Gamasutra's Top 10 Indie Games of 2010 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons#Preliminary_release_and_reception)).

## 868-HACK

**Release Date and Platforms**  
Initially released on August 30, 2013, for iOS and subsequently on January 27, 2015, for Windows and macOS ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK)).  

**Developer and Publisher**  
Developed and self-published by New Zealand designer Michael Brough ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK)).  

**Technical Specifications**  
Minimalist graphics evocative of the ZX Spectrum, with a procedurally generated 6×6 grid; custom audio recorded by the developer ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK#Development_and_release)).  

**Puzzle-Roguelike Mechanics**  
Combines dungeon-crawler perception with logic puzzles: players gather keys, hack data nodes, and manage limited actions while evading defense programs; every move requires tactical foresight on the small grid ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK#Gameplay)).  

**Key Innovations**  
Pioneered the "Broughlike": micro-scale roguelikes focusing tightly on individual mechanics, eschewing wait commands by treating attacks as movement, and implementing resource-based .WAIT abilities ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brough_(game_designer)#Design_philosophy)).  

**Development History**  
Created in March 2013 for the Seven-Day Roguelike competition under the working title "86856527"; polished over six months then ported to desktop, with expansion PLAN.B released July 23, 2017 ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK#Development_and_release)).  

**Current Status**  
Active with periodic minor patches; PLAN.B remains the only major expansion.  

**Critical Reception**  
Hailed for razor-sharp design, 868-HACK holds an 84/100 Metacritic for iOS. It was nominated for IGF Excellence in Design, received honorable mention for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize, and ranked #42 on Polygon's best games of the decade (2010–2019) ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK#Reception)).

## Imbroglio

**Release Date and Platforms**  
Full release on May 18, 2016, for iOS; no official desktop ports ([Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/game/imbroglio-2016)).  

**Developer and Publisher**  
Developed and self-published by Michael Brough in collaboration with Rostislav Pogosian ([Xsolla](https://x.la/g/imbroglio)).  

**Technical Specifications**  
Runs on iOS using Swift, featuring minimalist vector and bitmap graphics, with three expansions: Ossuary (Oct 2016), Phlogiston (Apr 2018), Mizzenmast (May 2020) ([Stately Play](https://statelyplay.com/2018/04/10/michael-brough-revisits-imbroglio-adds-phlogiston-expansion)).  

**Puzzle-Roguelike Mechanics**  
Imbroglio uses a 4×4 grid where each enemy and obstacle is a puzzle piece: players move in cardinal directions pushing or pulling targets to solve spatial puzzles under permadeath conditions, blending Sokoban-like constraints with roguelike randomness ([Gamasutra](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/273314/Freedom_through_constraints_The_design_of_Michael_Broughs_Imbroglio.php)).  

**Key Innovations**  
Married minimalistic puzzle mechanics to roguelike unpredictability; introduced progressively complex card-based resource systems for expansions, deepening single-mechanic exploration ([Wired](https://www.wired.com/2013/02/michael-brough/)).  

**Development History**  
Conceptualized post-868-HACK, Imbroglio was developed over six months with rigorous mechanical tuning; expansions added new flavor (elements, hazards, abilities) while preserving the core push-pull puzzle loop ([Michael Brough Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brough_(game_designer))).  

**Current Status**  
Available on iOS with active community modding guides; no further expansions planned.  

**Critical Reception**

Unity-based hex grid engine with pixel art, featuring procedural level generation and stamina-based action economy ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite_(video_game))).  

**Puzzle-Roguelike Mechanics**  
Hex-based turn-based strategy where each leap or attack consumes stamina; positioning puzzles against footmen, archers, wizards, and using altars to gain new abilities create a puzzle of movement and resource planning ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite_(video_game)#Gameplay)).  

**Key Innovations**  
Unified combat and waiting by linking attacks to stamina recharge, turning enemies into planning tools; unlockable gifts expand puzzle depth across runs.  

**Development History**  
Four-month development cycle by a solo Australian indie, inspired by tactical board games and roguelikes; post-launch added Challenge Mode for endless procedural levels ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite_(video_game))).

**Puzzle-Roguelike Mechanics**  
Fixed small grid forces immediate tactical puzzles: resource tokens, alien hazards, and gravity fields create spatial reasoning challenges more than traditional combat.  

**Key Innovations**  
Early application of small-grid constraints to force constant decision-making within the roguelike framework.  

**Development History**  
Michael Brough's first commercial title; iterated over several weeks post-IGD jam, establishing his signature style of 'micro roguelike' ([Michael Brough Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Brough_(game_designer))).
