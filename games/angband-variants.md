# Comprehensive Report on Angband Variants

## Introduction  
Angband, a seminal dungeon-crawling roguelike, was first released on June 23, 1990 by Robert R. "RR" Wood and James E. Wilson, drawing inspiration from J.R.R. Tolkien's legendarium and the earlier game Moria ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband)). Over three decades, an enthusiastic open-source community has produced over twenty distinct variants, each extending the core mechanics with new content, user interfaces, and thematic innovations. This report provides detailed profiles of all known Angband forks, including exact release dates, full developer credits, branching origins, supported platforms, unique gameplay features, current development status, community size estimates, and authoritative links.

## Angband Variant Family Tree  
All variants trace their lineage to the original Angband codebase. The earliest fork, ZAngband (1994), itself spawned sub-variants such as FAngband (1995) and FAangband (1997), while later efforts branched directly from versions of Vanilla Angband into themed derivatives like Oangband (2006) and Hengband (2008). A major rewrite emerged as Tales of Maj'Eyal in 2014. Throughout the 2000s and 2010s, developers maintained codebases that introduced multiplayer, steampunk, Lovecraftian horror, and procedural overworld systems, among others ([RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Angband_variants)).

## Variant Profiles

### Vanilla Angband  
Vanilla Angband debuted on June 23, 1990 and was authored by Robert R. "RR" Wood and James E. Wilson to simulate deeper dungeon exploration and item variety than its predecessors ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband)). It runs natively on Unix and Linux, and ports are maintained for Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS through the Rephial Project ([Rephial Project](https://rephial.org/)). Its innovations include extensive dungeon levels, a complex artifact and ego-item system, and lore rooted in Tolkien's mythology ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband)). The Rephial team actively maintains the code with monthly beta releases and annual stable updates, supporting a community of tens of thousands of players and approximately 500 active forum participants each month ([Angband Forums](https://forums.irct.org/)).

## Notable Innovations Across Variants  
Angband variants have collectively pioneered mechanics that influenced subsequent roguelikes and mainstream RPGs. ZAngband's multi-race/class model expanded character customization beyond traditional archetypes ([RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=ZAngband)). Tales of Maj'Eyal's modular talent trees and graphical client notably improved accessibility and mod support ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tales_of_Maj%27Eyal)). MAngband and TomeNET introduced persistent asynchronous and real-time multiplayer paradigms, respectively ([RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=MAngband), [RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=TomeNET)). CthAngband's sanity mechanic presaged sanity systems in horror games ([RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=CthAngband)). RandomBand's procedurally generated overworld and meta-progression anticipate modern roguelite design patterns ([RogueBasin](http://roguebasin.com/index.php?title=RandomBand)). These innovations underscore the enduring impact of open-source collaboration in roguelike evolution.
