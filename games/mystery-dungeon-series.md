# The Mystery Dungeon Series: A Comprehensive Game-by-Game Profile

## Introduction
The _Mystery Dungeon_ franchise—known in Japan as _Fushigi no Dungeon_—is a long‐running series of roguelike, turn‐based role-playing games conceived by Koichi Nakamura, founder of Chunsoft, as the company's first original IP following its work on the _Dragon Quest_ series ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mystery_Dungeon_video_games)). Across its many subseries—_Torneko's Great Adventure_, _Shiren the Wanderer_, _Pokémon Mystery Dungeon_, _Chocobo's Mystery Dungeon_, _Dragon Quest Mystery Dungeon_, _Etrian Mystery Dungeon_, and various spin-offs like _Asuka Kenzan_ and _One Way Heroics_—the franchise has iteratively refined its formula of randomly generated dungeons, permanent death, and strategic, tile-based combat.
