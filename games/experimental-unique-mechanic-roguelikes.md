## HyperRogue: Hyperbolic Geometry Exploration

HyperRogue, first released in November 2011, is a free, open-source roguelike by Zeno Rogue. It is available on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and OpenPandora, powered by SDL and a custom OpenGL renderer. The game's 72 procedurally generated "lands" exploit hyperbolic geometry: movement and combat unfold on a truncated order-7 triangular tiling displayed in the Poincaré disk model. Negative curvature causes pursuers to fall behind unless directly aligned, while hyperbolic tilings enable puzzle-like terrain textures. Initially created in Ludum Dare 2011, HyperRogue expanded during the 2012 Seven Day Roguelike Challenge and launched on Steam in January 2015. Version 12.0 (June 2021) added SteamVR support. Actively maintained, the game has been lauded as "one of the most interesting roguelikes" (*Exploring Roguelike Games*) and praised by Pocket Tactics for its Escher-inspired aesthetics.

## Noita: Pixel-Level Physics Simulation

Noita was developed and published by Nolla Games, entering early access on September 24, 2019, and reaching version 1.0 on October 15, 2020, exclusively for Windows using the Falling Everything engine. The platform-roguelike simulates every pixel: wood combusts to ash and smoke, lava solidifies upon water contact, and steam condenses into rain. The emergent physical system, coupled with a modular "wand building" mechanic—where wands' stats and spells' modifiers create unpredictable behaviors—delivers intense emergent gameplay. Noita's development extended secret puzzles and content post-launch, and as of 2025, it remains patched, with community-led exploration of its unsolved mysteries. Praised for its emergent physics, it resonated with the term "Noita'd" to describe unpredictable deaths. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noita_(video_game))

## Loop Hero: Auto-Battler Deck-Building

Loop Hero, released March 4 2021 for Linux, macOS, and Windows; December 9 2021 for Switch; April 4 2023 for Xbox; and April 30 2024 for Android and iOS, is a roguelike deck-builder by Four Quarters, published by Devolver Digital. Built in GameMaker, the game automates the hero's path and combat, tasking players with placing environment "cards" to modify loops. Terrain combos spawn resources or enemies, and end-of-loop retreats let players upgrade a persistent base. Born from a Ludum Dare 2019 prototype, balanced via Steam demo tests, Loop Hero has "generally favorable" reviews and is praised for its strategic freedom and retro aesthetic.

## 868-HACK: Data-Driven Hacking Roguelike

868-HACK, by Michael Brough, launched on August 30 2013 for iOS and January 26 2015 for Windows/macOS. This 6×6-grid roguelike places players in a cyberpunk "program" collecting data from walls that also spawn enemies. Its design eliminates waits with ranged attacks for Zugzwang mitigation, reflecting Brough's constraint-driven philosophy. Developed during the 2013 Seven-Day Roguelike, polished over ten months, it features minimalistic ZX Spectrum aesthetics. Honored for Excellence in Design at IGF 2014, it later received Polygon's "100 best games of the decade" and Paste's "50 Best Mobile Games of the 2010s." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/868-HACK)

## Imbroglio: Spatial Card Combat on a 4×4 Grid

Imbroglio, released May 18 2016 on iOS (with PC/macOS ports via community), is Michael Brough's 4×4 grid deck-builder. Each card, representing weapons, units, or modifiers, must be placed to trigger combat or combos, turning limited space into a puzzle. Eschewing wait commands, it emphasizes immediate spatial strategy. Announced April 2016, it earned an IGF 2017 Excellence in Design honorable mention as a hallmark of "Broughlike" minimalism.

## Desktop Dungeons: Puzzle Optimization Roguelike

Desktop Dungeons, by QCF Design, debuted as an alpha in November 2013 and fully released July 23 2015 on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android using GameMaker Studio. Dungeons span single screens; unlocking tiles reveals foes or resources, with all actions consuming a shared "run" metric, framing each level as a resource-optimization puzzle. Funded via Kickstarter, it supports an "Extreme Edition" mod, and was celebrated at IGF for its concise, strategic design. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Dungeons)

## Hoplite: Tactical Minimalism

Hoplite, by Dodge Roll (Jared Bailey), launched January 28 2014 on iOS, later ported to Windows, macOS, and Android via Unity. On a hex grid, players push enemies with shield attacks and navigate orbs granting tetromino-like abilities. The game's strict movement and turn economy focus purely on spatial tactics. Metacritic 85; praised by TouchArcade and Pocket Gamer for its elegant constraint. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoplite_(video_game))

## Invisible Inc.: Stealth Tactics

Invisible Inc., by Klei Entertainment, released May 12 2015 on Windows, macOS, Linux, and PS4 using an in-house engine. Agents infiltrate procedurally generated facilities under turn-based stealth rules; fog of war, sight cones, and turn counters create emergent infiltration puzzles. Expansions added varied difficulty, and BAFTA nominations and Canadian Videogame Award wins acknowledged its innovative tactics. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Inc.)

## FTL: Faster Than Light: Spaceship Management

FTL: Faster Than Light, by Subset Games, launched September 14 2012 on Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS/Android, built with HaxeFlixel. The real-time-with-pause system assigns crew to ship modules—shields, engines, weapons—while managing oxygen, fires, and boarders. Random events and permadeath create highly replayable runs. Funded via Kickstarter, the Advanced Edition DLC (2014) added ships and events. IGF 2013's Excellence in Design, BAFTA nominee. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTL:_Faster_Than_Light)

## Papers, Please: Bureaucracy Simulation

Papers, Please, by Lucas Pope/3909 LLC, launched August 8 2013 on Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and PS Vita via Unity. Players inspect entry documents under evolving rules, balancing bribes, denials, and moral choices amid time constraints. Its mundane bureaucracy becomes a tense puzzle narrative. IGF and BAFTA accolades for Innovation and Narrative cemented its impact. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please)

## Return of the Obra Dinn: Detective Deduction

Return of the Obra Dinn, by Lucas Pope/3909 LLC, released October 18 2018 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Switch, PS4, and Xbox One using a custom 1-bit renderer on Unity. The "Memento Mortem" watch reveals death scenes for deductive identification of crew fates. Logical elimination within a stark monochrome aesthetic underpins each solution. IGF 2019's Excellence in Design and Best Narrative, BAFTA Game of the Year awarded. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn)

## Baba Is You: Rule Manipulation

Baba Is You, by Hempuli Oy (Arvi Teikari), launched March 13 2019 on Windows, macOS, Linux, Switch, iOS, and Android with Unity. Game rules are represented as movable word tiles; rearranging 'BABA IS YOU' or 'FLAG IS WIN' rewrites core logic, enabling meta-puzzle solving. Ludum Dare 2017 prototype expanded into a BAFTA-winning, IGF-excellence title, inspiring abundant community-created levels and studies in rule-based emergent gameplay.
