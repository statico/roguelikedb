# Roguelike Database

An **AI-driven research project** providing a comprehensive, searchable database of roguelike games. Built using **Claude Code** and **Exa AI** for systematic game discovery and documentation, with three core directories: `media/` (Git LFS), `data/` (YAML files), and `web/` (Astro site with TypeScript and pnpm).

> [!NOTE] > **ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Research**: This database was systematically researched and documented using Claude Code with Exa AI web search capabilities. Every game entry contains comprehensive research data including historical context, technical achievements, cultural impact, and community analysis.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Database**: Extensive collection of roguelike games with detailed metadata
- **Rich Classification System**: Multi-dimensional taxonomy for precise game discovery
- **Terminal Web Interface**: Classic roguelike aesthetic with Astro, TypeScript, and React
- **Lineage Tracking**: Fork relationships and game genealogy visualization
- **Automated Research**: Claude Code integration for continuous game discovery
- **Media Management**: Git LFS-based media storage organized by game slug

## Project Goals

This database serves multiple communities:

- **Players**: Discover new games based on detailed preferences and filtering
- **Researchers**: Analyze genre evolution and game design patterns
- **Game Developers**: Research roguelikes for inspiration and learning
- **Content Creators**: Find games for reviews, streams, and articles

## Contributing

**User contributions are more than welcome!** While this database was built using AI-driven research, community contributions are essential for maintaining accuracy, adding missing games, and providing diverse perspectives.

### Ways to Contribute

1. **Add Missing Games**: Submit new roguelike entries with comprehensive data
2. **Improve Existing Entries**: Enhance descriptions, add missing metadata, or correct errors
3. **Contribute Media**: High-quality screenshots, logos, or gameplay videos
4. **Report Issues**: Flag inaccuracies, broken links, or outdated information
5. **Suggest Features**: Propose new classification systems or database improvements

### Adding New Games

1. Create YAML file in `data/` using game slug as filename
2. Add media files to `media/[slug]/` directory
3. Follow the JSON Schema in `docs/schema.json`
4. Submit pull request with game data and media

#### Example Game Entry

### Development Workflow

- Content changes don't require local development setup
- Web interface changes require Node.js and pnpm
- All YAML files are validated against JSON Schema during build
- Media files automatically discovered by slug matching

## Design Philosophy

### Terminal Aesthetic Guidelines

- **No Modern UI Elements**: No drop shadows, gradients, or rounded corners
- **Sharp, Pixelated Edges**: Everything feels like a classic terminal interface
- **Monospace Typography**: Uses monospace fonts for authentic roguelike feel
- **High Contrast**: Classic terminal color schemes (amber on black, green on black, etc.)
- **ASCII Art**: Box-drawing characters for visual elements
- **Grid-Based Layout**: Align everything to character grids like classic roguelikes

### Color Palette

- **Classic Terminal Colors**: Amber (#FFB000), Green (#00FF00), White (#FFFFFF)
- **Dark Backgrounds**: Pure black (#000000) or very dark grays
- **Accent Colors**: Classic roguelike colors (red for danger, blue for magic, etc.)
- **No Gradients**: Solid colors only, no smooth transitions

## Data Schema

The database uses a comprehensive JSON Schema for validation. Key fields include:

- **Basic Info**: name, slug, description, release dates, developers
- **Classification**: primary_type, subgenres, gameplay_features, difficulty
- **Lineage**: forked_from, parent_games, notable_forks, fork_type
- **Links**: official_website, steam_page, github_repo, wiki
- **Media**: logo, screenshots, videos (auto-discovered by slug)
- **Community**: active_development, open_source, license, community_size
- **Technical**: engine, source_language, system_requirements

## Lineage System

The database tracks relationships between games:

### Fork Types

- `direct_fork` - Code fork with modifications
- `major_variant` - Significant gameplay changes
- `spiritual_successor` - Inspired by but rewritten
- `commercial_adaptation` - Licensed/commercial version
- `community_continuation` - Community takeover
- `inspired_by` - Influenced by but not directly derived

### Example Lineage

```
Rogue (1980)
  ï¿½ Hack (1984)
    ï¿½ NetHack (1987)
      ï¿½ SlashEM (2000)
      ï¿½ UnNetHack (2007)
      ï¿½ NetHack 4 (2013)
```
