  Advanced Rogue is a roguelike game developed by Michael Morgan and Ken Dalka, released in 1984. It represents the first major expansion and enhancement of the original Rogue, introducing significant new gameplay mechanics including character classes and team-based gameplay.

  ## Character Classes
  Advanced Rogue was the first roguelike to implement character classes, introducing distinct playstyles including Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, and others. Each class features unique abilities, equipment access, and statistical progressions, providing meaningful choices that affect gameplay strategy.

  ## Team-Based Gameplay
  The game pioneered team management mechanics, allowing players to control multiple characters with complementary abilities. This system introduced cooperative elements and tactical coordination requirements that added strategic depth to traditional dungeon exploration.

  ## Technical Implementation
  Advanced Rogue was developed in C and demonstrated sophisticated programming within the constraints of early 1980s computing. The game maintained performance efficiency while adding complex new features, with versions available for Unix and DOS systems.

  ## Historical Impact
  As the first major enhancement of Rogue, Advanced Rogue established important precedents for roguelike development. Its character class system became a widely adopted convention throughout the genre, and its design influenced numerous subsequent roguelike games, including Super Rogue.

  ## Open Source Legacy
  Advanced Rogue is released under the BSD license, making its source code freely available for study and modification. This open source approach has enabled community preservation efforts and serves as an educational resource for understanding early roguelike development techniques.

  ## Influence and Legacy
  The game's innovations in character specialization and party mechanics established foundational concepts that influenced decades of roguelike development. Its approach to enhancing existing gameplay systems while preserving core mechanics became a template for future roguelike expansions.
