  Heat Signature is a stealth-action roguelike developed by Suspicious Developments, released in 2017. The game features procedural spaceship infiltration with emergent storytelling and creative problem-solving mechanics set in deep space environments.
  
  ## Gameplay Mechanics
  
  Heat Signature combines real-time stealth mechanics with pause-and-plan tactical infiltration across procedurally generated spaceship layouts. Each mission features unique ship designs with randomly generated objectives including rescue missions, assassinations, theft, and sabotage. Players can hijack vessels and use them for future missions while navigating ship complexity that scales from simple shuttles to massive battle cruisers.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  
  Built using the Unity engine, the game features seamless ship-to-ship movement with realistic space physics including zero-gravity movement and momentum. Dynamic lighting systems affect stealth gameplay through shadows and visibility mechanics. The modular ship generation creates procedural layouts while maintaining hand-crafted feel, with performance optimization ensuring smooth operation of complex systems.

  ## Emergent Gameplay
  
  The game emphasizes improvised solutions where plans rarely survive initial contact with mission realities. Creative problem-solving is encouraged through multiple approaches to every challenge, with weapons and gadgets used in unexpected ways. Player agency allows complete freedom in approach and execution, ensuring significant replay variety for identical objectives.
