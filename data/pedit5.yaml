  Pedit5 is recognized as the first computer dungeon crawler, developed in late 1975 by Reginald "Rusty" Rutherford at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The game was created as a solo programming project on the PLATO system using the TUTOR programming language over a period of 4-6 weeks.
  
  ## Historical Significance
  Pedit5 holds the distinction of being the first computer role-playing game to feature dungeon exploration mechanics. The game pioneered procedural generation techniques for monster encounters and treasure placement, while establishing permadeath mechanics with save-and-resume functionality between gaming sessions. It directly influenced subsequent PLATO titles including dnd and orthanc, founding key roguelike conventions that remain in use today.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  The game operated on PLATO graphical terminals connected to networked IBM and CDC mainframes. It supported up to 20 saved characters and rendered a single-level dungeon consisting of 40-50 rooms using on-screen character graphics. Due to storage limitations, the game employed fixed map layouts while implementing procedural generation for monsters and treasure.
  
  ## Gameplay Mechanics
  Pedit5 featured an integrated class system that combined fighter, magic user, and cleric abilities into a single character type. Combat was turn-based and resolved automatically following player actions. The game incorporated D&D-inspired mechanics including hit points, character levels, and an experience point system. Player interaction utilized a simple control scheme with options to Fight (F), cast Spells (S), or Run (R) during encounters.
  
  ## Preservation and Legacy
  The game maintains strong preservation status within PLATO emulator communities, particularly through the Cyber1 project. Reconstructed source code from PLATO archives enables play on modern systems. The name "pedit5" derives from the game being stored in the fifth program slot of Rutherford's PLATO group account.
