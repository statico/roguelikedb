  Cogmind is a sci-fi roguelike developed by Josh Ge at Grid Sage Games, evolving from a 2012 7DRL Challenge entry through public alpha (May 2015), beta (May 2017), to Steam Early Access on October 16, 2017.
  
  ## Component System
  The game features over 1000 salvageable and equippable parts, each with unique properties and functions. Players dynamically customize their robot character by building from scavenged components. The environment is destructible, allowing players to blast through walls, hack machines, and interact with a living robotic ecosystem where every robot has purpose and relationships. Advanced stealth mechanics provide alternatives to direct combat.
  
  ## Technical Features
  Built with a custom C++ engine optimized for ASCII rendering, the game initially launched as Windows-exclusive with performance and stability optimization. The ASCII interface has received recognition from PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun. Optional tile support maintains the ASCII aesthetic while improving visual clarity. The game is closed source but provides community mod tools and enhancement support.
  
  ## Gameplay Design
  Multiple victory paths support combat, stealth, hacking, or hybrid approaches. Complex AI behaviors create faction relationships and allegiance systems. Players progress by ascending through robotic facility levels while managing resources including power, heat, and component durability. Procedural generation is combined with carefully crafted encounter design.
  
  ## Development and Recognition
  Josh Ge's solo development approach maintains traditional roguelike values while advancing interface and accessibility. The game has received attention from major gaming publications including PC Gamer and Rock Paper Shotgun as an example of modern roguelike evolution, praised for combining complex systems with intuitive presentation.
