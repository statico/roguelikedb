  AceHack is a NetHack variant developed by Jérôme Péron, released in 2019. The variant focuses on modernizing the user experience of NetHack while preserving its traditional gameplay mechanics.

  ## Key Features
  AceHack introduces several user interface improvements over standard NetHack:
  - Customizable UI system allowing players to configure interface elements
  - Menu-driven commands designed to reduce NetHack's learning curve
  - Enhanced message logging with improved information retention
  - Crash recovery systems to prevent progress loss
  - Replay functionality for analyzing and sharing gameplay sessions

  ## Technical Implementation
  The variant is implemented in C and maintains cross-platform compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Despite the enhanced features, the game maintains modest system requirements with 64MB of memory and 50MB of storage space.

  ## Development
  AceHack is actively developed and maintained through a GitHub repository, following contemporary software development practices. The project emphasizes community engagement and incorporates player feedback into ongoing improvements.

  ## User Experience Focus
  The variant prioritizes accessibility and modern interface design principles. Key improvements include organized command structures, comprehensive logging systems, and customization options that accommodate diverse player preferences. The design aims to make NetHack more approachable for new players while retaining its traditional complexity.

  ## Community and Impact
  AceHack has developed a small but dedicated community of players who appreciate the modern interface enhancements. The project serves as an example of how classic roguelikes can incorporate contemporary user experience design without compromising their core gameplay identity.
