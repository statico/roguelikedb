  Gumband is a roguelike game that serves as a humorous variant of Angband. Developed by ZapM and the Gumband Development Team starting in 2000, the game maintains the core gameplay mechanics of Angband while adding whimsical elements and cartoon-inspired aesthetics.

  Development and Features:
  Released in 2000, Gumband reached version 2.0.4 through continuous development. The game transforms traditional Angband monsters and items with cartoon-inspired designs and humorous naming conventions. Despite the lighthearted theme, the game preserves the challenging difficulty and complex mechanics that characterize traditional roguelikes.

  Gameplay:
  The game features cartoon-inspired monster designs, silly item names, and humorous descriptions throughout the game world. Players navigate through procedurally generated dungeons using turn-based combat mechanics inherited from Angband. The game maintains the extreme difficulty level typical of Angband variants while presenting content through a whimsical lens.

  Technical Implementation:
  Written in C using a modified Angband engine, Gumband supports multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and macOS. The game requires minimal system requirements of 8MB RAM and 12MB storage space. Both ASCII and tile graphics are supported.

  Community and Development:
  The game attracted a small but dedicated community of players who appreciated the unique combination of humor and traditional roguelike challenge. Development has ceased, but the game remains available under the Angband license as open source software.

  Legacy:
  Gumband demonstrated that roguelike games could successfully incorporate humor and whimsical themes without compromising gameplay depth or difficulty. It served as an example of how thematic modifications could create distinct gaming experiences within established roguelike frameworks.
