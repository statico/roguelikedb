  **The foundational game that defined the roguelike genre** - Created by Michael Toy and Glenn Wichman (later Ken Arnold and Jon Lane) at UC Berkeley, included in **4BSD UNIX manuals in November 1980** as a C program leveraging the curses library (~50 KB source).
  
  **Revolutionary Innovations:**
  - **Permadeath** - First game to make character death permanent and meaningful
  - **Procedurally generated multi-level dungeons** - Every playthrough unique
  - **ASCII-based TUI** with iconic @ symbol for player character  
  - **Turn-based tactical combat** with strategic positioning
  - **vi editor movement keys** (h,j,k,l) that became roguelike standard
  - **Item identification mechanics** requiring experimentation
  
  **Technical Achievement:** Implemented sophisticated algorithms for dungeon generation, line-of-sight, and game state management within ~32-64 KB RAM constraints on Unix minicomputers.
  
  **Historical Impact:** **Named and defined the entire roguelike genre**, directly inspiring Hack (1982), Moria (1983), and countless successors. Commercial ports by **Epyx** (North America) and **Mastertronic** (Europe) brought roguelikes to home computers with added graphical tiles.
  
  **Legacy:** Established virtually every convention still used in modern roguelikes - from @ player symbol to procedural generation philosophy. Modern open-source ports preserve the original source code under permissive licenses, ensuring continued accessibility.
