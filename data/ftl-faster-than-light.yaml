  FTL: Faster Than Light is a spaceship management roguelike developed by Subset Games that raised $200,000 on Kickstarter and sold over 2.5 million copies, proving commercial viability for complex indie roguelikes.
  
  ## Commercial Success
  The game raised $200,542 on Kickstarter in September 2011 (2000% funded) and sold over 2.5 million copies across all platforms. It became one of the highest-grossing indie games of the early 2010s and demonstrated the commercial viability of complex indie roguelikes.
  
  ## Gameplay Design
  The game features real-time spaceship management with pause-and-plan tactical combat. Eight unique starship layouts each require different strategies. Complex crew management involves species including Humans, Engi, Mantis, Rockmen, Zoltan, and Crystals. The system-based damage model allows targeting specific ship systems like engines, weapons, oxygen, and shields. Procedural galaxy exploration provides branching narrative encounters.
  
  ## Technical Features
  Built with a custom C++ engine optimized for real-time systems simulation, the game features elegant UI design that makes complex management accessible. Cross-platform success includes Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS versions with minimal system requirements enabling wide accessibility.
  
  ## Advanced Edition Expansion
  The 2014 Advanced Edition provided a free major content update with new systems including the Lanius alien species with unique abilities, mind control and hacking systems for additional tactical options, clone bay alternatives to medical bays for crew revival, and new weapons, drones, and encounters that doubled the content.
  
  ## Industry Impact
  FTL defined the 'spaceship management' subgenre and inspired numerous similar games. The game received mainstream media coverage and influenced AAA development, with larger studios adopting its mechanics. It has become a subject of academic study for procedural narrative design.
  
  ## Design Philosophy
  The game embraces a 'failure is fun' philosophy where deaths create interesting stories. It features perfect information with no hidden mechanics, creating pure strategy gameplay. Emergent storytelling develops through procedural encounters, while the design achieves accessibility through depth - simple to learn but difficult to master.
  
  ## Legacy
  FTL demonstrated that complex indie roguelikes could achieve mainstream commercial success, paving the way for the indie roguelike boom of the 2010s. It established Kickstarter as a viable funding source for innovative game concepts.
