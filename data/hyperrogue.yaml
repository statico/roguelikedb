  HyperRogue is a mathematical roguelike developed by Zeno Rogue that combines advanced mathematics with gaming, featuring hyperbolic geometry gameplay, over 100 unique lands, and educational excellence with academic recognition.
  
  ## Hyperbolic Geometry
  The game utilizes authentic hyperbolic plane mathematics as the first and only roguelike with a non-Euclidean game world. True mathematical infinity creates unlimited gameplay possibilities through curved space navigation based on advanced geometric principles. The hyperbolic plane is rendered on Euclidean displays to create a unique visual experience while maintaining mathematical authenticity through accurate implementation of complex geometric theorems.
  
  ## Lands System
  Over 100 lands demonstrate different aspects of hyperbolic geometry, each featuring unique gameplay mechanics with distinct rules, enemies, and challenges. The lands are designed with educational progression to gradually introduce increasingly complex mathematical concepts. World structure encourages deep mathematical understanding through interconnected exploration, with infinite content creation through geometric algorithms.
  
  ## Educational Impact
  Universities use the game for teaching hyperbolic geometry and advanced mathematics, making complex concepts accessible through interactive gameplay. Educators integrate the game into geometry education curricula. Mathematical research utilizes the game for visualization and understanding, creating cross-disciplinary impact bridging mathematics, computer science, and game design education.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  A custom graphics engine renders hyperbolic geometry through purpose-built systems. Complex mathematical computations perform in real-time using geometric algorithm mastery. Unique mathematical frameworks provide spatial representation through innovative coordinate systems. Performance optimization enables efficient rendering of computationally intensive geometric operations while maintaining mathematical precision and geometric authenticity.
  
  ## Recognition
  The game received Independent Games Festival recognition with multiple nominations for innovation and design. Prominent mathematicians and educators have endorsed the project. Game design awards recognize unprecedented genre innovation and execution. Educational institutions and mathematics organizations have provided educational honors, with international acclaim at mathematical conferences and gaming exhibitions.
  
  ## Open Source Impact
