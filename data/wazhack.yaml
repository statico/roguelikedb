A spectator mode allows players to observe others' attempts in real-time.
  
  ## Mobile Accessibility
  
  The game includes comprehensive tutorial systems that gradually introduce complex roguelike mechanics to new players. Context-sensitive controls adapt the user interface based on the current situation, while visual inventory management is optimized for touch interaction. The save-anywhere functionality accommodates mobile gaming patterns.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
