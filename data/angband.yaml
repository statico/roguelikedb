  The game features a 100-level dungeon descent to defeat Morgoth, the Dark Enemy. Players can choose from 13 character classes and multiple races including Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, and Half-Elves. The game includes a magic system with spell books, an artifact system featuring items from Tolkien's works, and a monster memory system that records information about encountered enemies.
  
  Setting and Content:
  Angband incorporates authentic Tolkien elements including creatures such as Balrogs, Dragons, and Nazg√ªl, as well as artifacts like Sting, the One Ring, and the Silmarils. The game includes a town level where players can purchase supplies and interact with NPCs.
  
  Technical Implementation:
  The game is written in C and released under the GPL-2.0 license. It supports multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, macOS, Unix, and Android. The game uses ASCII graphics by default with optional tile graphics support.
