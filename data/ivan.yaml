description: |
  IVAN (Iter Vehemens ad Necem) is a roguelike developed by Timo Kiviluoto featuring revolutionary body part systems, material physics simulation, and unforgiving complexity that creates detailed combat mechanics through scientific authenticity and anatomical precision.
  
  ## Body Part Simulation
  Every body part including arms, legs, torso, and head is simulated separately with unique properties. Lost limbs create permanent gameplay changes and tactical adaptations. Prosthetic replacement provides artificial limbs with different material properties and functional characteristics. Damage systems are based on realistic human anatomy and physiological consequences, with physical trauma affecting character performance and decision-making capacity.
  
  ## Material Physics
  The comprehensive material system includes hundreds of substances with authentic physical and chemical properties. Equipment deteriorates through realistic environmental and usage factors including corrosion and degradation. Temperature effects impact materials, characters, and environmental interactions. Acid, fire, and other substances behave according to realistic chemical principles, with complex relationships between different substances creating emergent tactical possibilities.
  
  ## Difficulty
  Every decision carries potential for permanent character alteration through unforgiving consequence systems. Mastery requires deep understanding of complex interconnected systems with an intense learning curve. Hundreds of ways to die exist through realistic cause-and-effect relationships. Traditional gaming conveniences are eliminated in favor of authentic simulation, appealing specifically to players seeking maximum challenge and complexity.
  
  ## Development
  Released under GPL licensing, complete source code is available for community study and enhancement. The IVAN Development Team maintains and expands the original vision through GitHub preservation ensuring long-term availability and collaboration. Implementation details are accessible for learning simulation programming while open architecture enables community content creation and system enhancement.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  Built with C++ for high-performance complex real-time calculations, the game uses sophisticated data structures managing enormous simulation complexity. Advanced mathematical modeling covers physical and biological systems while preserving vast amounts of simulation state across gaming sessions. Cross-platform compatibility maintains simulation accuracy across Windows, Linux, and DOS versions.
  
  ## Combat System
  Tactical positioning depth enables body part targeting creating complex strategic combat decisions. Equipment interaction affects combat through realistic physical properties. Damage calculation authenticity bases injury systems on scientific understanding of trauma. Medical accuracy appears in wound management and recovery processes while terrain, weather, and circumstances affect battle outcomes.
  
  ## Recognition
  IVAN is revered among traditional roguelike enthusiasts for its uncompromising vision and serves as a benchmark for complexity and authenticity in game simulation. The game is used for studying advanced game simulation techniques and implementation, with community dedication to maintaining and improving the codebase. It represents an important milestone in roguelike evolution and simulation gaming.
  
  ## Authenticity
  Core genre elements are preserved despite simulation complexity, maintaining traditional mechanics respect. Character-based display preserves classic roguelike aesthetics through ASCII graphics tradition. Turn-based precision enables careful tactical planning through methodical turn structure. Procedural generation supports emergent simulation experiences while permanent consequences create high-stakes gameplay tension.
  
  ## Scientific Approach
  Game systems are based on authentic scientific principles through realistic physics modeling. Body systems are designed with medical accuracy and authenticity. Substance properties are based on real-world chemical and physical data while living systems are simulated according to biological understanding. Technical implementation reflects scientific methodology with engineering precision.
