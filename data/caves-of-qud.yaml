  Caves of Qud is a science fantasy roguelike developed by Freehold Games, reaching full version 1.0 on December 5, 2024, after development beginning in 2007.
  
  ## Critical Reception
  The game received the IGF 2025 Excellence in Narrative Award, marking the first time a roguelike has won this major narrative honor. It also won the 2025 Hugo Award for Best Game and received a D.I.C.E. Award nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Indie Game Development. The game achieved a 91/100 score on Metacritic with 100% positive recommendations on OpenCritic.
  
  ## World Design
  The game features a partially pre-made, partially procedural open world with simulation-driven history. A complex faction reputation system affects the entire world state, creating a living ecosystem where every creature has needs, relationships, and purposes. The game's lore spans thousands of years of post-apocalyptic history, with procedural generation seamlessly integrated with authored content.
  
  ## Character System
  Players choose between True Kin (humans with cybernetic enhancements) or Mutants (beings with genetic mutations). The game features over 70 unique physical and mental mutations that affect gameplay. The skill system allows players to learn from creatures and NPCs through water rituals, while individual body parts, limbs, organs, and systems are tracked through detailed simulation.
  
  ## Technical Features
  Built using the Unity engine, the game offers both ASCII and tile graphics options with character portraits. It supports modding and is available on Windows, macOS, and Linux with controller support.
  
  ## Development Team
  The development team is led by Brian Bucklew, Jason Grinblat, Caelyn Sandel, and Nick DeCapua, based in South Bend, IN and Berkeley, CA. Art is provided by Samuel Wilson and Cyril van der Haegen, with music composed by Craigory Hamilton and Brandon Tanner.
