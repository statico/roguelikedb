description: |
  Infra Arcana is a Lovecraftian horror roguelike developed by Martin Tornqvist that authentically captures H.P. Lovecraft's cosmic horror through innovative sanity mechanics, psychological terror, and early 20th century authenticity.
  
  ## Sanity System
  The game features psychological deterioration mechanics where mental state affects perception, decision-making, and character capabilities. Sanity loss occurs from witnessing incomprehensible alien entities and phenomena. Terror responses create tactical consequences and strategic considerations. Mental recovery methods include rest, medication, and environmental factors affecting psychological healing. Insanity consequences create permanent mental alterations that change character abilities and world perception.
  
  ## Lovecraftian Atmosphere
  Set in the early 20th century with period-appropriate weapons, technology, and cultural references, the game incorporates cosmic horror themes including ancient entities, forbidden knowledge, and reality-warping phenomena. The academic protagonist reflects Lovecraft's typical educated protagonists. Dungeon designs draw inspiration from Lovecraft's familiar New England geography while maintaining faithful adaptation of source material themes and narrative elements.
  
  ## Visual Design
  ASCII graphics create psychological tension and dread through character-based representation. Strategic color palette usage enhances mood and atmospheric immersion. Interface elements contribute to overall atmospheric presentation while clear representation of complex horror themes occurs through minimalist graphics. ASCII limitations become atmospheric advantages through creative design choices.
  
  ## Development
  Released under GPLv3 licensing, complete source code is available for community study and enhancement. GitHub collaboration enables modern development practices and community contributions. Martin Tornqvist maintains consistent artistic vision while incorporating player suggestions that preserve thematic integrity. Implementation details are accessible for studying horror game design.
  
  ## Psychological Horror
  The game emphasizes terror and dread rather than explicit gore or combat. Environmental design conveys narrative through spatial arrangement while mystery-solving elements reflect Lovecraft's detective fiction influences. Learning dangerous information creates mechanical consequences, and sanity loss affects player perception of the game world through reality distortion effects.
  
  ## Recognition
  The game appears prominently in gaming press recommendations and "best roguelikes" lists. It is recognized as a premier example of effective horror in roguelike design and praised for faithful translation of literary themes into interactive medium. The game is used in courses studying horror game design and literary adaptation.
  
  ## Technical Features
  Built with a custom SDL engine optimized for atmospheric ASCII presentation, the game maintains cross-platform compatibility across Windows, Linux, and macOS. Performance optimization enables smooth gameplay despite complex psychological and atmospheric systems. The save system reliably preserves progress supporting extended horror narrative experiences.
  
  ## Character Development
  Skill progression reflects period-appropriate knowledge and abilities while equipment maintains accuracy to early 20th century technology. Inventory systems reflect physical and practical limitations. Character background integration provides starting attributes and abilities reflecting the academic protagonist, with progressive revelation as characters learn and adapt to cosmic horror realities.
  
  ## Design Philosophy
  Game systems serve thematic goals rather than traditional optimization, with atmosphere prioritized over mechanics. Literary authenticity ensures faithful representation of source material themes and tone. Mental health systems are based on authentic understanding of trauma while characters face genuine threats from psychological rather than physical dangers. Mechanics reinforce themes of human powerlessness and cosmic insignificance.
