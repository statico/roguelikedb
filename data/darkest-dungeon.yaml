  Darkest Dungeon is a turn-based roguelike RPG developed and published by Red Hook Studios, released on January 19, 2016. The game is notable for its integration of psychological stress mechanics alongside traditional dungeon-crawling gameplay, set in a gothic horror atmosphere inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft.
  
  ## Gameplay Mechanics
  The game features a unique stress and affliction system where characters can develop psychological conditions that affect their behavior and abilities. Players manage a roster of heroes across 17 different character classes, each with distinct abilities and roles in combat. The turn-based combat system incorporates positional tactics, with characters arranged in front and back rows affecting their available actions.
  
  ## Stress System
  Darkest Dungeon's stress mechanics simulate psychological trauma, with characters potentially developing over 100 different afflictions or positive traits based on their experiences. The system includes a quirks system that assigns permanent character traits, and party dynamics where stress can spread between team members during challenging encounters.
  
  ## Visual and Audio Design
  The game features hand-drawn gothic artwork by Chris Bourassa in a distinctive comic book style. The narration by Wayne June has been widely praised for its atmospheric contribution to the game's horror themes. The visual design emphasizes dark, medieval aesthetics consistent with cosmic horror literature.
  
  ## Commercial Success and Reception
  Darkest Dungeon has sold over 5 million copies across multiple platforms and received positive critical reception. The game was initially released through Steam Early Access, building a community during development. It has received several downloadable content expansions and spawned a sequel, Darkest Dungeon II, released in 2023.
  
  ## Cultural Impact
  The game has been noted for its influence on the integration of psychological mechanics in video games. Several quotes from the game's narrator have become popular internet memes. The game has been subject to academic study regarding its treatment of psychological horror in interactive media and has influenced other developers' approaches to stress and mental health mechanics in games.
  
  ## Legacy
  Darkest Dungeon established psychological stress management as a viable strategic element in roguelike design. The game demonstrated that emotional states could function as core mechanical systems rather than purely narrative elements, influencing subsequent development in the genre.
