- **Legendary narrator** - Wayne June's haunting voice acting became iconic
- **Lovecraftian atmosphere** with cosmic horror themes
- **Comic book art style** bringing static images to life through animation

**Strategic Depth:**
- **17 unique character classes** each with 7 combat skills and camping abilities
- **Position-based combat** - Front/back row tactics with reach limitations
- **Light management** - Darkness increases difficulty but improves rewards
- **Hamlet management** - Upgrade buildings, recruit heroes, manage resources
