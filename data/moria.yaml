  Moria is Robert Alan Koeneke's 1983 literary roguelike that brought Tolkien's Middle-earth to the genre, establishing the template for depth-based dungeon exploration and spawning the entire Angband family lineage.
  
  ## Literary Adaptation
  As the first Tolkien roguelike, Moria features an authentic Middle-earth setting in the Mines of Moria with proper names, locations, and lore from The Lord of the Rings. The atmospheric dungeon design includes 50 levels descending into the ancient dwarven kingdom, culminating in an epic confrontation with the Balrog as the final boss. Canonical monsters include orcs, trolls, and other creatures from Tolkien's works.
  
  ## Technical Innovation
  Originally developed in Pascal on VMS (Digital Equipment Corporation systems), the game featured unprecedented 50-level dungeon depth for early roguelikes. Advanced armor and weapon systems provided equipment complexity while magic items including rings, wands, and potions offered complex interactions. Six core character statistics affected gameplay mechanics.
  
  ## Historical Significance
  Moria serves as the direct ancestor to dozens of Angband variants and was ported from VMS Pascal to C for broader accessibility. Developed at the University of Oklahoma computing center, it provided an open source foundation enabling community development and inspired the 1980s wave of Tolkien-themed dungeon crawlers.
  
  ## Gameplay Foundations
  Turn-based exploration enables methodical dungeon navigation and combat through ASCII character-based graphics that defined early roguelike aesthetics. Permadeath consequences create single-life, high-stakes gameplay while procedural generation provides randomized dungeon layouts ensuring replayability. Resource management includes food, light sources, and equipment durability.
  
  ## Preservation and Community
  Version 4.87 represents the final official release maintaining original design. The game remains available through academic and hobbyist archives with recognition from the Angband community as the spiritual grandfather of variants. Well-documented codebase and gameplay mechanics provide educational value for studying early roguelike design principles.
  
  ## Cultural Impact
  Moria proved licensed properties could enhance roguelike depth as a literary gaming pioneer. Every Angband variant traces lineage to Moria, establishing it as the family tree patriarch. The game demonstrated roguelikes as serious computer science projects with academic respectability, maintained by dedicated community historians through preservation efforts.
  
  ## Development Legacy
  Created by Robert Alan Koeneke as a university project, Moria demonstrated that literary depth and complex systems could coexist in ASCII games. It established design principles that influenced decades of roguelike development while proving collaborative development could preserve and extend foundational games.
