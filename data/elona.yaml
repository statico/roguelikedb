The game features multiple professions ranging from shopkeeper to musician, complex base building systems, and extensive crafting and trading mechanics.
  
  ## Pet and Companion System
  A distinctive feature of Elona is its comprehensive pet system that allows players to capture, breed, and train virtually any creature encountered in the game. The system includes complex stat growth, skill learning, and personality development for companions, with genetic manipulation through breeding creating hybrid creatures with combined abilities.

The game's success has inspired other developers to explore unconventional approaches to roguelike design and has contributed to the international recognition of Japanese doujin game culture.
