  ADOM (Ancient Domains of Mystery) is a roguelike role-playing game developed by Thomas Biskup, initially released in 1994. The game is notable for its complex systems, extensive character development options, and unique corruption mechanics.

  ## Gameplay Mechanics
  ADOM features a distinctive corruption system where characters can become gradually corrupted through exposure to chaotic forces and magical effects. This corruption can provide benefits but also permanent negative consequences, creating strategic risk-reward decisions. The game combines traditional dungeon exploration with an overworld map containing towns, wilderness areas, and multiple dungeon systems.

  ## Character Development
  The game offers 12 character classes, each with distinct abilities and progression paths. Characters develop through a comprehensive skill system with hundreds of available skills, complemented by a talent system based on birth signs that influence character development. The game includes complex crafting systems for item creation and modification.

  ## World Design
  ADOM features both procedurally generated dungeons and handcrafted areas, including an overworld with towns, wilderness regions, and interconnected locations. The game incorporates narrative elements through quests and storylines woven into the exploration gameplay.

  ## Development History
  Thomas Biskup has continuously developed ADOM for over 30 years, with ongoing updates and content additions. The game received commercial releases and crowdfunding support, leading to modern versions with graphical tiles and Steam integration while maintaining its traditional ASCII option.

  ## Recognition and Influence
  ADOM is frequently cited as one of the definitive examples of traditional roguelike design and is included in the Berlin Interpretation of roguelike characteristics. The game has been studied academically and has influenced numerous other roguelike developers.

  ## Technical Aspects
  The game is available across multiple platforms including DOS, Windows, Linux, and macOS. Despite its complexity, ADOM maintains efficient performance and reliable save systems to handle its extensive game state.
