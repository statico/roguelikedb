description: |
  Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup is a traditional roguelike that evolved from Linley's Dungeon Crawl in 2006, focusing on removing tedious mechanics while preserving strategic depth.
  
  ## Design Philosophy
  The game eliminates grinding by providing experience from exploration rather than repetitive actions. It removes arbitrary time pressure through the absence of starvation mechanics and prevents item destruction from use or environmental effects. The streamlined inventory system avoids weight limits and complex item management while ensuring all mechanics remain transparent to players.
  
  ## Recognition and Community
  DCSS won Roguelike of the Year in 2008 and maintains consistent top rankings in roguelike lists. The game features an active tournament scene with annual competitions and global participation. It offers web-playable access through browsers and has maintained active development for over 18 years with regular releases.
  
  ## Technical Features
  The webtiles interface provides browser-based play with graphics support. Players can switch seamlessly between ASCII and tile modes. Built with a C++ engine optimized for tactical calculations, the game supports Windows, Linux, macOS, Web, and Android platforms.

  ## Character System
  The game offers 27+ character species with unique racial abilities and restrictions, plus 27 backgrounds defining starting equipment and skills. Character progression uses 26 skill categories with XP-based advancement. The spell system includes over 100 spells across multiple schools, with tactical positioning making every move significant in combat.
  
  ## Dungeon Design
  DCSS features 15+ unique branches, each with distinct themes and challenges. The rune system requires collecting 3 of 15 runes to access final areas, with flexible branch order allowing multiple valid progression paths. Intelligent monster AI creates enemies that use tactics and teamwork, while vaults and special rooms provide hand-crafted encounters within procedural generation.
