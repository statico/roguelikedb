slug: "citadel-ti84"
description: |
  Citadel is a roguelike game developed by Dennis Yang for the TI-84+ CE graphing calculator, released in 2021. The game demonstrates the technical feasibility of implementing complex roguelike mechanics within the severe hardware constraints of educational computing devices.
  
  ## Technical Implementation
  The game operates within the TI-84+ CE's hardware limitations, including a 6 MHz Z80-type processor, 32KB of RAM, and a 96×64 monochrome LCD display. The implementation utilizes pseudo-3D corridor visualization and optimized tile graphics that consume only 1KB of RAM. Game data persistence is achieved through creative use of the calculator's flash memory sectors.
  
  ## Gameplay Features
  Citadel incorporates traditional roguelike elements including turn-based combat, permadeath mechanics, and procedural dungeon generation. The game features character progression systems, statistical advancement, and equipment mechanics adapted for the calculator's input interface. Navigation uses grid-based movement controlled through the calculator's keypad.
  
  ## Development and Community
  The game was developed using C programming with the TI AppLib development environment. The project is open source and has been supported by the CEMetech calculator programming community. The availability of source code serves as an educational resource for students learning calculator programming techniques.
  
  ## Educational Significance
  Citadel represents an example of constrained environment programming, demonstrating advanced programming concepts within educational hardware limitations. The project illustrates memory optimization techniques, efficient resource allocation, and creative solutions for implementing complex systems on minimal hardware.
  
  ## Cultural Impact
  The game contributes to the tradition of calculator gaming in educational environments and demonstrates the entertainment potential of educational computing devices. It serves as an example of innovative programming within extreme hardware constraints and has inspired similar projects within the calculator gaming community.
